### Why do we need this repair manual?

Since Land Rover is not able to offer reasonable dates. We have to wait for month to get a repair date.

Because Land Rover is so damn expensive!!!!
  * Land Rover charges ~1000€ for changing 4 glow plugs. WTF!
    * Why is it so expensive?? Because of its bad design! Steps to change the glow plugs:
      1. Disconnect the battery ground cable. Refer to: Specifications (414-00 Battery and Charging System - General Information, Specifications).
      1. Remove the intake manifold. YES you need to remove the intake manifold for changing the glow plugs!
        1. Remove the fuel filter. Refer to: Fuel Filter (310-01B Fuel Tank and Lines - TD4 2.2L Diesel, Removal and Installation).
