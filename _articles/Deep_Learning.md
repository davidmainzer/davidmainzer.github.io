*I will add more information related to AI especially Deep Neural Networks from time to time.*


This is a summary of some of the resources that I have either found useful myself or heard people.

## General Machine Learning

### Classes

* [Coursera's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Coursera's Machine Learning Class") - This Coursera class, taught by Andrew Ng

### Reading

* [Machine Learning by Chris Bishop](http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387310732)
* [Machine Learning by Kevin Murphy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-0)

### Programming

* [SciKitLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "SciKitLearn")

## Deep Learning
