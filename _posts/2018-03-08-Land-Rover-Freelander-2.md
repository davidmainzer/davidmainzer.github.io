## Freelander 2

Since nearly 1.5 years we own a Freelander 2.

### Engine

  * KW (PS) 112 KW (152 PS)
  * Acceleration: (0-100 km/h) 11.7 s
  * Top speed: (km/h) 181
  * Number of gears: 6
  * Torque: 400 nm
  * Fueal: Diesel
  * Cylinder 4
  * Gearing: Automatic
  * Drive type: Allrad permanent
  
### Problems
  
  * Engine does not start if its cold outside (<-1°C)
    * Fuel filter changed --> problem still exists
    * Use of high quality fuel --> problem still exists
    * Land Rover has no glue why this problem occurs. Land Rover would prefer to exchange all components at the customer's expense.
  * Oil inside intercooler
  * DPF full -> DPF regeneration does not work properly

### Why do we need this repair manual?

Since Land Rover is not able to offer reasonable dates. We have to wait for months to get a repair date.

Because Land Rover is so damn expensive!!!!
  * Land Rover charges ~1000€ for changing 4 glow plugs. WTF!
    * Why is it so expensive?? Because of its bad design! Steps to change the glow plugs:
      1. Disconnect the battery ground cable. Refer to: Specifications (414-00 Battery and Charging System - General Information, Specifications).
      1. Remove the intake manifold. YES you need to remove the intake manifold for changing the glow plugs!
         1. Remove the fuel filter. Refer to: Fuel Filter (310-01B Fuel Tank and Lines - TD4 2.2L Diesel, Removal and Installation).
         1. ... many steps to proceed. 
      1. To install, reverse the removal procedure.
